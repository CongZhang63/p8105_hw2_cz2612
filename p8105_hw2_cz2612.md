This is my solution to Homework 2.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

## Problem 1

First, define a path to the dataset.

``` r
path_to_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
    read_xlsx(
        path = path_to_data,
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

Read precipitation data\! For 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    relocate(year)
precip_2017 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
    relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation dataframes. In the following code
chunk, I create a “helper” tibble that contains pairs of numeric and
character ways of representing month, and then merge that (using month
number as a key) with the precipitation dataset. This technique is one I
use often when I need to recode a moderate or large number of values for
a variable.

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )
precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

Read the NYC Transit data.

``` r
nyctransit_df = 
    read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
    mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

The resulting NYC Transit dataset contains the following variables:
line, station\_name, station\_latitude, station\_longitude, route1,
route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10,
route11, entrance\_type, entry, vending, ada.

My data cleaning steps so far are as follows: First, import the NYC
Transit data from a csv file by using the `read_csv` function. Second,
clean the variable names with the `clean_names` function. Third, retain
the required variables with the `select` function. Finally, change the
entry variable from character to logical variable by using the `mutate`
and `recode` functions.

The resulting dataset has 1868 rows and 19 columns. I don’t think the
data are tidy because the columns from route1 to route11 have mixed
information. These variable names (route1 to route11) are actually route
names, and the variable values are actually route numbers. Therefore,
the data should be converted to a long format, separating the
information into two variables, in order to become a more tidy dataset.

Answers to the three questions:

  - There are 465 distinct stations.

  - 84 distinct stations are ADA compliant.

  - 37.704918% of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance.

Reformat the data.

``` r
nyctransit_reformat_df =
  mutate_at(nyctransit_df, vars(route1:route11), as.character) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_name",
    values_to = "route_number"
  )
```

60 distinct stations serve the A train. Of the stations that serve the A
train, 17 are ADA compliant.
